# 3d-print-qPCR
A qPCR machine based on 3d printable parts.

Traditional PCR machines use a precision machined heat block. This is not viable with consumer 3D printers. Instead forced air temperature control will be used as demonstrated by the light bulb PCR machine http://www.russelldurrett.com/lightbulbpcr.html

Issues caused by sample evaporation will be minimized by continuous centrifuging the samples, returning liquid to the base of the tube.
